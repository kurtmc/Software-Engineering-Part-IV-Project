This is an example test that can be used with the eclipse plugin to measure
student performance.

Run `export_test.sh` to copy the incomplete branch without the .git folder and
give this to a student with the Eclipse plugin to complete.

When complete run `save_test.sh your_name` to zip the directory including the
.git folder.
