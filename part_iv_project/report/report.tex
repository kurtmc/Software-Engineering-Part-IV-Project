\section{Introduction}
In the world today programming and programs are prevalent and abundant in our
every day lives. So it follows that programming is an important skill. It's
widely accepted that programming is a difficult skill to learn
\cite{jenkins2002difficulty, robins2003learning}. There is a need to innovate
and come up with some solutions to help students be more effective in class.
When students struggle in class with tests and assignments they can be lead to
plagiarism or even dropping out\cite{bennedsen2007failure}. Currently in many
institutions, software engineering courses test their students on their
knowledge and skill in a way that is artificial to real world programming,
namely tests are done with pen and paper and without access to computers with
IDE`s, compilers or the internet. So in this project we want to come up with a
way to give software engineering students robust testing environments that allow
students to have a more realistic set of tools during the test. However whilst
giving students these tools we would also like to give the teaching staff
confidence that plagiarism can be detected automatically without tedious manual
inspection of student submissions as well as detecting plagiarised work that the
student has attempted to conceal.
% TODO overview of report

% Background: (contains technical aspects)
% * what is eclipse
% * mention some of the plaigirism tools that exist, mention how the only analyse end result
% - ACP (some plugin) exists but it lacks features
\section{Background}
Eclipse is an IDE (integrated development environment) that is written is Java.
It can be used to develop in a variety of programming languages. And it also has
a plugin architecture which allows other developers to extend it's functionality
without changing it's core implementation.

There are several plagiarism detection tools available for institutions to use,
two of which are MOSS\cite{schleimer2003winnowing} and
JPlag\cite{lutz2000jplag}. Both these systems are used on submissions from
students to help identify any similarities between students. If the student
submissions are too similar these tools could detect that and warn the lecturer
that plagiarism is the likely cause of this similarity.

A tool called ACP (Active Classroom Programmer)\cite{giacaman2015active} is used
at the University of Auckland in some SOFTENG 701 and 751. ACP is an eclipse
plugin that allows the lecturer to create eclipse workspaces and upload
snapshots of the current state to a web server. For example during a lecture a
task can be completed in parts and once each part is complete a snapshot of the
code can be uploaded. The students, during the lecture can download these
snapshots using the ACP eclipse plugin, onto their laptops and make
modifications and experiment with the workspace, they can also attempt to
complete the next part before the lecturer has completed it. Often there are
short breaks during the lecture that allow students to attempt the tasks.

Active Test Programmer (ATP) is an extension to ACP which allows the lecturer to
setup a programming test. The programming test can be distributed to students
before the test starts. The test is encrypted so a secret code is needed to
decrypt the tests. When a secret code is distributed to the students they may
type it in and begin the test. After a predetermined amount of time the the test
is over and the students must submit their code through the eclipse plugin.

% Active Test Programmer:
% - no implementation details
% - features
% - plaigirism module
% - teacher visualisation tool
\section{Active Test Programmer}
For my project, we are going to extend ATP to give lecturers confidence that
plagiarism that has occurred during the test can be detected automatically. The
way this will be done is the history of the student completing the test will be
recorded and when the test is submitted the history will go with it. This
history gives us much richer insight into the characteristics of the students
work. Analysis of the history of the students submission will allow for more
robust detection of potential plagiarism.

\subsection{Features} \label{sec:Features}
Create tests: The lecturer will be able to create a programming test in their
IDE and upload it. Once the test is uploaded the lecturer will be given a secret
code that can be used to begin the test.

Download tests: Students will be able to download tests from within their IDE,
they may not begin the test until they have entered the secret code to decrypt
the test. This allows all the students to download and be ready for the test, so
that everyone may begin at the same time, and no students will feel
disadvantaged because it took them longer to download the test, or if WiFi is
unavailable the test may be distributed on a USB flash drive.

Upload completed test: Students may upload their completed test through their
IDE. If WiFi is unavailable they may export their completed test to an archived
file and copy it to a flash drive to give to the lecturer. The archived
completed test will contain information about when it was exported so that we
can be sure they completed the test in the given time.

Implementation history: The completed test that the student uploads, will
contain a complete history in snapshots over time of how the test was
implemented. This gives a rich insight into potential plagiarism in the history
of the code.

Viewing reports: Reports can be generated that contain analyses of student
tests. In the analyses it will contain a score of how likely it was that the
students submission contains plagiarised work. The history also gives us the
opportunity to go beyond just checking for plagiarism.
% Interim Report:
% - technologies considered, pros/cons (why eclipse for instance)
% - related work (research)
\section{Technologies Considered}
% libgit2, eclipse because ACP already developed, research???
For this project the client application will be implemented using the Eclipse
plugin framework. There are other IDE's that could potentially be used because
it also have a plugin architecture for example IntelliJ but Eclipse was chosen
because ACP is already implemented for Eclipse and it's going to be extended to
contain the features outlined in \nameref{sec:Features}.

For recording the history of the changes to files in the students test, libgit2
will be used. libgit2 can be used to store the history of a file in a series of
commits. The reason libgit2 will be used is that is has a permissive license so
it can be integrated into this project without license concerns. Implementing
a system of storing changes to a file isn't feasible for a small project like
this so libgit2 is a good fit.


% Implementation:
\section{Implementation}
% libgit2, eclipse text listener, prototype
So far into the project I have made a small prototype to demonstrate some of the
functionality. This prototype confirms that it is possible to record the history
of a students work. I have made a modification to the ACP plugin that attaches a
listener to the current document the user is editing. The listener receives an
event for every keystroke in the document. It also receives events when a paste
is done, so it possible to see what is in the clipboard when the user pastes.

% Evaluation:
% - students
% - how accurate
% - performance metrics
\section{Evaluation}
To evaluate the effectiveness of the tool, mock tests will be performed with
volunteers to gather some test data. Some of the volunteers will be asked to
copy one another and conceal it. These submissions will be used to evaluated the
accuracy of plagiarism detection. It will also be a good opportunity to get user
feedback and find out about potential bugs and problems before the tool is used
in a more realistic setting.

% Conclusions
\section{Conclusions}
% Some conclusion. Solution can be used in a more general sense, not just
% related to plaigirism
Many student tests today to not assess students in a practical manner. The reason
I think that pen and paper tests are popular is because lecturers are concerned
that practical tests will give students an easy opportunity to plagiarise work.
The goal of Active Test Programmer (ATP) is to remove doubt from lecturers that
plagiarism will be caught. ATP gives confidence to lecturers that attempts at
concealing plagiarism will be found in the history of the students work. More
over plagiarism detection is just one of the benefits of looking into the history
of the code. In fact a more general analysis could give us information about
where the student may have been struggling during the test by looking at how
long it took a student took to implement a particular method or class. This
information could be used to guide the lecturer on which topics to focus on in
class and therefore give students a more effective learning experience.
