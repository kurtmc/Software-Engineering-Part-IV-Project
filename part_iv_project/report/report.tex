\section{Introduction}
In the world today programming and programs are prevalent and abundant in our
every day lives. So it follows that programming is an important skill. It's
widely accepted that programming is a difficult skill to learn
\cite{jenkins2002difficulty, robins2003learning}. There is a need to innovate
and come up with some solutions to help students be more effective in class.
When students struggle in class with tests and assignments they can be lead to
plagiarism or even dropping out\cite{bennedsen2007failure}. Currently in many
institutions, software engineering courses test their students on their
knowledge and skill in a way that is artificial to real world programming,
namely tests are done with pen and paper and without access to computers with
IDE`s, compilers or the internet. So in this project we want to come up with a
way to give software engineering students robust testing environments that allow
students to have a more realistic set of tools during the test. However whilst
giving students these tools we would also like to give the teaching staff
confidence that plagiarism can be detected automatically without tedious manual
inspection of student submissions as well as detecting plagiarised work that the
student has attempted to conceal.

% Background: (contains technical aspects)
% * what is eclipse
% * mention some of the plaigirism tools that exist, mention how the only analyse end result
% - ACP (some plugin) exists but it lacks features
\section{Background}
Eclipse is an IDE (integrated development environment) that is written is Java.
It can be used to develop in a variety of programming languages. And it also has
a plugin architecture which allows other developers to extend it's functionality
without changing it's core implementation.

There are several plagiarism detection tools available for institutions to use,
two of which are MOSS\cite{schleimer2003winnowing} and
JPlag\cite{lutz2000jplag}. Both these systems are used on submissions from
students to help identify any similarities between students. If the student
submissions are too similar these tools could detect that and warn the lecturer
that plagiarism is the likely cause of this similarity.

A tool called ACP (Active Classroom Programmer)\cite{giacaman2015active} is used
at the University of Auckland in some SOFTENG 701 and 751. ACP is an eclipse
plugin that allows the lecturer to create eclipse workspaces and upload
snapshots of the current state to a webserver. For example during a lecture a
task can be completed in parts and once each part is complete a snapshot of the
code can be uploaded. The students, during the lecture can download these
snapshots using the ACP eclipse plugin, onto thier laptops and make
modifications and experiment with the workspace, they can also attempt to
complete the next part before the lecturer has completed it. Often there are
short breaks during the lecture that allow students to attempt the tasks.

Active Test Programmer (ATP) is an extention to ACP which allows the lecturer to
setup a programming test. The programming test can be distributed to students
before the test starts. The test is encrypted so a secret code is needed to
decrypt the tests. When a secret code is distributed to the students they may
type it in and begin the test. After a predetermined amount of time the the test
is over and the students must submit their code through the eclipse plugin.

% Active Test Programmer:
% - no implementation details
% - features
% - plaigirism module
% - teacher visualisation tool
\section{Active Test Programmer}
For my project, we are going to extend ATP to give lecturers confidence that
plaigirism that has occured during the test can be detected automatically. The
way this will be done is the history of the student completing the test will be
recorded and when the test is submitted the history will go with it. This
history gives us much richer insight into the characteristics of the students
work. Analysis of the history of the students submission will allow for more
robust detection of potential plaigirism.

% Interim Report:
% - technologies considered, pros/cons (why eclipse for instance)
% - related work (research)
\section{Technologies Considered and Related Work}
% libgit2, eclipse because ACP already developed, research???

% Implementation:
\section{Implementation}
% libgit2, eclipse text listener, prototype

% Evaluation:
% - students
% - how accurate
% - performance metrics
\section{Evaluation}

% Conclusions
\section{Conclusions}
% Some conclusion. Solution can be used in a more general sense, not just
% related to plaigirism
