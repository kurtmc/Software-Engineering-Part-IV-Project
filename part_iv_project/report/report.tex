\section{Introduction}
In the world today programming and programs are prevalent and abundant in our
every day lives. So it follows that programming is an important skill. It's
widely accepted that programming is a difficult skill to learn
\cite{jenkins2002difficulty, robins2003learning}. There is a need to innovate
and come up with some solutions to help students be more effective in class.
When students struggle in class with tests and assignments they can be lead to
plagiarism or even dropping out\cite{bennedsen2007failure}.

% Background: (contains technical aspects)
% - what is eclipse
% - mention some of the plaigirism tools that exist, mention how the only analyse end result
% - ACP (some plugin) exists but it lacks features

% - no implementation details
% - features
% - plaigirism module
% - teacher visualisation tool
