% This is the outline for the report
% Introduction:
% - project scope
% - to what extent

% - software/software engineering is important
% - programming is difficult
% - struggling in class can cause plaigirism, dropping out
% - contributions this projects makes to the world
% - overview of report

% Background: (contains technical aspects)
% - what is eclipse
% - mention some of the plaigirism tools that exist, mention how the only analyse end result
